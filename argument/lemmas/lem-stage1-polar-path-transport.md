kind: lemma
contract: Parameterized polar-path transport: there exist C_path^0, C_pol^0 >= 1 and kappa_pol^0 in (0, 1/2] such that, for every def-stage1-polar-witness-data tuple W with C_path >= C_path^0, C_pol >= C_pol^0, and 0 < kappa_pol <= kappa_pol^0, for every finite-dimensional exact-unit epsilon_r-C*-algebra, every delta > 0 with C_pol*(epsilon_r + delta) <= kappa_pol, every U_0, U_1 in calU, and every q in [0, 1] satisfying ||U_1 - U_0|| <= q, C_path*q <= 1/4, and C_path*(q + epsilon_r*q + q^2) < delta - C_pol*(epsilon_r*delta + delta^2), every L_{Z_t} is invertible and every Z_t = (1-t)*U_0 + t*U_1 lies in calUbar_{C_path*(q + epsilon_r*q + q^2)} for t in [0, 1], and, writing u_delta for the unique first component of the inverse of Pi_delta: calU x B^{calH}_delta(J) -> S_delta := Pi_delta(calU x B^{calH}_delta(J)), Pi_delta(U, H) = U bold-dot H, the map H(t, U_0, U_1) = u_delta(Z_t) is jointly continuous in (t, U_0, U_1), joins U_0 to U_1, and satisfies H(t, cU_0, cU_1) = c*H(t, U_0, U_1) for every c in U(1).

**Status.** `stated` candidate transcribed VERBATIM from the audited
`DESIGN-S1-POLAR-v6.md` §3 row 13f (final verdict LAND; the v5-audit
u_delta-outside-domain defect is CLEARED-BY the finite-dimensional
insertion matched to base row 7 and polar row 4). Not proved in-repo;
af elevation per the design's projected budget 4/2.

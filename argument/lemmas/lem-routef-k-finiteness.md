**Status.** Landed verbatim from the hostile-audited design; `stated` (transcribed, unchecked
in-repo) and `af: none`. Landing promotes NOTHING -- the mathematics is adjudicated by the af
elevation queue (fresh prover, separate fresh verifier), not by this transcription.

**Numbered equations.** `(1.1)`--`(1.8)` are the closed scalar-ledger equations of
`docs/plans/2026-07-26-LEDGER-DOMAINS-design/DESIGN-LEDGER-DOMAINS-v2.md` sect-1, with audit
correction 1 (`rho_id^corr`) applied. The ledger is serial: every coefficient and radius is a
finite max/min/sum/product of quantities produced by declared dependencies, and
`AUDIT-LEDGER-DOMAINS-v2.md` sects-4--5 independently recomputed it as finite, positive,
noncircular, and dimension-free.

**Elevation note.** The projected af budget for this row is 4 / 2 (nodes / rounds), per the
design's sect-2 table. Rows that import [[lem-thmainext-conditional]] consume it AT CONTRACT LEVEL
as a black-box producer of `C_E, epsilon_E`; under the linker's status-propagation rule their L0
closure is capped by that row's own elevation.

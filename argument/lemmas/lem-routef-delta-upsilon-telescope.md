contract: After first fixing one global witness package W_RF supplied by lem-routef-raw-factor-setting-formation, for every input (H,Phi,eta) to which that formation result applies, fix one def-routef-raw-factor-setting datum S over that same W_RF supplied by the same result, for every Delta' supplied for (W_RF,S) by lem-routef-delta-prime-closeness, every Delta supplied from that same Delta' by lem-routef-delta-normalization-closeness, every Upsilon' supplied from that same pair by lem-routef-upsilon-prime-closeness, and every Upsilon supplied from that same triple by lem-routef-upsilon-normalization-closeness, writing the fields of (W_RF,S) as the unqualified symbols below: Delta-Upsilon telescope: for rho_DeltaUpsilon := min{rho_theta, rho_T, rho_id, rho_Delta, rho_Upsilon} and 0 <= eta <= rho_DeltaUpsilon, ||Delta Upsilon - Phi||_cb <= (C_theta+C_Delta+2*C_Upsilon)*eta.

**Status.** Landed from the hostile-audited designs; `stated` (transcribed, unchecked
in-repo). Landing promotes NOTHING -- the mathematics is adjudicated by the af
elevation queue (fresh prover, separate fresh verifier), not by this transcription.

**Numbered equations.** `(1.1)`--`(1.8)` are the closed scalar-ledger equations of
`docs/plans/2026-07-26-LEDGER-DOMAINS-design/DESIGN-LEDGER-DOMAINS-v2.md` sect-1, with audit
correction 1 (`rho_id^corr`) applied; they are carried as derived notation of the scalar
header `W_RF` by [[def-routef-raw-factor-setting]]. The ledger is serial: every coefficient
and radius is a finite max/min/sum/product of quantities produced by declared dependencies,
and `AUDIT-LEDGER-DOMAINS-v2.md` sects-4--5 independently recomputed it as finite, positive,
noncircular, and dimension-free.

**Ambient binding (2026-08-05 rescope).** The contract's prefix binds the ambient
finite-dimensional UCP/cb setting through [[def-routef-raw-factor-setting]] (data/notation
only) and [[lem-routef-raw-factor-setting-formation]] (existence, global-W_RF-first). The
mathematical suffix is byte-identical to the 2026-08-03 landing.

**Elevation note.** The projected af budget for this row is 4 / 2 (nodes / rounds), per the
design's sect-2 table. Rows that import [[lem-thmainext-conditional]] consume it AT CONTRACT LEVEL
as a black-box producer of `C_E, epsilon_E`; under the linker's status-propagation rule their L0
closure is capped by that row's own elevation.

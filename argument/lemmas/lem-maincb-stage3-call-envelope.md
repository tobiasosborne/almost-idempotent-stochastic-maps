kind: lemma
contract: After first choosing a universal c0 witness for which lem-maincb-error-improvement remains valid, fixing the corresponding L^0,e_env^0 witnesses of lem-maincb-direct-corner-envelope, and fixing the C_cross^0,e_cross^0 witnesses of lem-maincb-cross-class-merging-datum, there is a universal K_3^0 >= 1 with every Stage-3 prerequisite absorbed such that for every def-maincb-witness-ledger datum W with W.c0_cb = c0, W.L >= L^0, W.K3 >= max{K_3^0,1,W.L,W.c0_cb*W.L}, and W.e_cross <= e_cross^0, if A is a finite-dimensional extended epsilon-C*-algebra, w:C^m->A is an extended W.c0_cb*epsilon-inclusion satisfying ||w(I_{C^m})-I_A|| <= W.c0_cb*epsilon with one-dimensional atomic images, a supplied MAIN partition state for A,w has disjoint nonempty unions U,V sharing no class and R=U union V, 0 <= epsilon <= W.e_cross/W.K3, and supplied current reset isomorphisms v_U:B_U->A_U and v_V:B_V->A_V satisfy d_U <= W.c0_cb*epsilon_U, d_V <= W.c0_cb*epsilon_V, ||v_U(I_{B_U})-u_{A_U}|| <= W.c0_cb*epsilon_U, and ||v_V(I_{B_V})-u_{A_V}|| <= W.c0_cb*epsilon_V, then epsilon_U,epsilon_V,epsilon_R <= W.L*epsilon and t_3=W.K3*epsilon dominates all datum errors and both displayed unit norms, so lem-maincb-cross-class-merging-datum furnishes the explicit Stage-3 four-corner raw-call datum with rho <= C_cross^0*t_3.

A hard-cap hit is a factoring stop, not a rounds bump. Constants live in the
proof body, never the contract.
